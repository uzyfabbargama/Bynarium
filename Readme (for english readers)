# 🧠 Bynarium — imagine one AI in 1KB

## 📌 Project Title
**Bynarium**  
A symbolic artificial intelligence model built from scratch, with no weights, no backpropagation — explainable, lightweight, and structurally creative.

---

## 🚀 What is it and what does it do?

**Bynarium** is a new AI paradigm that does **not** rely on big data or error-based training. Its logic is based on:

- Conditional binary structures (`1`, `0`, `N/A`)
- Rules that create semantics from **form**
- Models in under **1KB of code (~400 lines)**
- Explainable AI, programmable in **natural language (Spanish)**

It's **not the same** to say `n1, 5` as `n1, 4`, even in powers of 2.  
**Structure generates meaning**, and that’s what makes it powerful.

## ⚙️ Installation / Execution

- Requires only **Python**
- No external libraries
- No datasets or files needed

Just clone the repository and run:

```bash
python bynarium.py
🧪 How to Use / Examples
Bynarium accepts commands in Spanish or mixed language:
crea: A1, 8
This creates a neuron A1 with 8 bits, capable of storing up to 16 parameters (from other neurons or the user).

🔀 Favorite Commands
bif — bifurcate
Send parameters from one neuron to others:
bif: n1, n2, n3
Passes values from n1 to n2 and n3.

comb — combine
Symbolically merges neurons:
n1 expands, n2 shrinks.
comb: n1, n2
Example:
n1 (8 bits) → 9 bits
n2 (8 bits) → 7 bits
🧪 Project Status
🔬 Experimental
It works, but may misinterpret some commands. Still under testing phase.
